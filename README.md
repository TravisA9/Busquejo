# Busquejo
Outline tool: can be used to give a talk or stay on schedule. 

Take a look at [an example](https://travisa9.github.io/Busquejo/)

Or, [click here](https://travisa9.github.io/Busquejo/docs/empty.html) for an empty document. Then make changes and save it (Ctrl+S) to your computer.

I origionally started making this to have better control over how my talk outline looked and acted. Some computer glitches as well as some limitations to other software was a bit of a newsence to me when combined with my shortcommings.

Due to the pandemic Many are having schedule and time keeping troubles, so I got to thinking that this might be useful to make a schedule that can actually help keep time for you. 

I plan to make some improvements, but feel free to recommend changes if you like.
